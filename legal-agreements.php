            </ul>
            <p>
                <span class="section-title">9. Initial Quote Terms, Acceptance of Quote, Order Confirmation, and Terms and Conditions</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                When a quote is provided, it generally includes the price, description of services,
                materials to be used, and estimated timelines. At this stage,
                the quote serves as an offer but does not bind either party legally.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the customer accepts the quote, it often leads to the creation
                of a binding contract. This acceptance can be formalized through written
                communication, a signed agreement, or by placing an order through the
                website.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the quote is accepted and the order is placed, the terms of the quote
                 typically become part of the official contract
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="section-title">10. Customization and Detailed Agreement</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                For custom upholstery work, there may be a more detailed agreement outlining
                specific fabrics, designs, and customizations requested by the customer.
                This agreement will detail the obligations of both parties, including
                any responsibilities the customer has (e.g., providing specific measurements or approving design drafts).
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="section-title">11. Enforcement of Contract</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                If the customer fails to adhere to the terms (e.g., non-payment or cancellation), the company can enforce the contract terms, potentially seeking legal remedies for breaches.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conversely, if the upholstery company fails to deliver as per the agreed terms, the customer can hold them accountable based on the contractual obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="section-title">12. Additional Terms</span>
            </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to the aforementioned terms, the following provisions apply:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="section-title">
                                Cancellation Of Order:
                            </span>
                            <p>
                            If the customer cancels the order after making the downpayment,
                            the downpayment is owned to Sargento Upholstery. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="section-title">
                                Non-Recepient of Finished Product:
                            </span>
                            <p>
                                If the customer fails to receive the finished product 
                                within 30 days of completion and notification of availability,
                                ownership of the product reverts to Sargento Upholstery.
