        <h2 class="text-gold">History of Sargento Upholstery</h2>
        <p>Established by Eddielberto Sargento in Negros Occidental, Sargento Upholstery has quietly thrived in the furniture industry for nearly three and a half decades, specializing in custom-made furniture. Known for its commitment to quality craftsmanship and flexibility in adapting to changing market trends, the business has managed to sustain itself over the years. In 1997, a strategic decision was made to relocate the business to Taguig, a move aimed at expanding its reach and meeting the evolving demands of the market. This relocation, though not widely recognized, played a crucial role in the continued success of Sargento Upholstery.</p>
